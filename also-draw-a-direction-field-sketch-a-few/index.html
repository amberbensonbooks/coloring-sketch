<p><strong>Also Draw A Direction Field Sketch A Few</strong>, A direction field is a graph made up of lots of tiny little lines each of which approximates the slope of the function in that area. To sketch the phase plane of such a system at each point x0y0in the xy-plane we draw a vector starting at x0y0 in the direction. To sketch this information into the direction field we navigate to the coordinate point x y xy x y and then sketch.</p>
