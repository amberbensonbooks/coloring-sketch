<p><strong>Why Are Sketches Gray In Solidworks Drawing</strong>, I played around with color settings but I couldnt find the property that affects sketched lines within the drawing.

If the sketch is grey it means its not an active sketch aka you arent editing the sketch You can still use it for a feature by clicking on what feature you want to create and then clicking the sketch either in the feature tree on the left hand side or on the actual grey sketch.</p>
